# Amulet design notes

These are a series of notes about the Amulet programming language. I'm trying to split them into
3 areas:

 - **Language:** How we want the language to act. The features we want and how we want the language
   to act.
 - **Syntax:** How we want the language to look.
 - **Standard library:** Modules, methods and types in the standard library.
