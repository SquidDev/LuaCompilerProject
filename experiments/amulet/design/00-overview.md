# Amulet - Overview

Amulet is another functional-esque language.

## Aims
 - Functional language, though not purely functional
 - Immutable

> **To consider:** Dependent/refined types. The issue here is that this requires creating a theorem/proof solver.
  Personally I feel it would be better to include assertions in the type signature but enforce them at runtime, unless
  they can be proved false.
