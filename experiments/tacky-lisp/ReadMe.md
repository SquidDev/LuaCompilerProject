# Tacky Lisp
A hacked together Lisp varient which compiles to Lua.

 - Features more complex data types. Whilst this removes Lisp's simplicity it
   makes the language faster

## Todo list
 - Don't break on recursive definitions
 - Allow defining variables after their usage on the top level.
 - Support for quasi-quote/unquote in resolver
 - Unquote in top level to "escape" compiler?
